pressing a key on the keypad creates a random sound generated by the 
6 oscillators.... all is lfo automatable .....as for midi ....can't remember

anyway just press a key then the lopp deck at the bottom records the sound 
and you can save as a wav

a+b is semitone scale
c is linear

this is a  remake glitch up of the 2002 metalon seq.

just mess with with it

ta damion.
